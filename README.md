Modus Create Javascript Coding Puzzle
=====================================

Create a simple calendar application capable of switching between month and week views.

The month view should show the month name in the header, days in the month, and events created.

The week view should show start and end dates in the header. Days should show hour lines.

Populate with a minimum of three events.
* One event should be a whole day event
* One event should last 90 minutes
* One of the events needs to span across two days

The calendar should load the current month/week. Events should fall into the current week.

The calendar does **not** need switch weeks/months. It's quite alright if it's fixed to the current week and month.


## Rules
* Fork this repository and create the first commit as soon as you start coding
* Use any frameworks and libraries, or none at all
* Submit a pull request once done
* Your working example's source code should not be minified or otherwise obfuscated

## Tips
* Write human readable code
* Include comments wherever possible

## Bonus Points
* Create two overlapping events
* Add the ability to select a timeframe within the week view by selecting start time, then dragging selection to the end time. Touchend or click event should output start and end times as Date objects.
